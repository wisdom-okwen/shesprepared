PrEP is a daily medication that can help prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at high risk of getting infected. It's like a vaccine, but instead of preventing the disease before it starts, PrEP prevents the virus from taking hold in your body.

Here's how it works:

1. **Daily pill**: You take a pill every day, usually a combination of two medications called emtricitabine and tenofovir.
2. **Blocks HIV**: The medication creates ""walls"" around your cells, making it difficult for HIV to enter and infect them.
3. **Prevents infection**: By blocking HIV, PrEP prevents the virus from taking hold in your body and causing infection.

PrEP is **very effective**:

* Reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken correctly.
* Reduces the risk of getting HIV from injecting drugs by over 70%.

HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. HIV is usually spread through:

* Unprotected sex (sex without condoms or other forms of protection)
* Sharing needles or other equipment for injecting drugs
* From mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

**How does HIV affect the body?**

HIV attacks the CD4 cells, which are a type of white blood cell that helps fight off infections. When HIV infects these cells, it can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off other infections and diseases.

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), a disease that severely damages the immune system.

**How is HIV transmitted?**

HIV is usually spread through:

* Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal) with an infected person
* Sharing needles or injection equipment with an infected person
* Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

**What are the symptoms of HIV?**

Early symptoms of HIV can be similar to flu-like symptoms and may include:

* Fever
* Fatigue
* Swollen lymph nodes
* Skin rashes
* Sore throat

* When taken daily, PrEP creates a barrier in the body that makes it difficult for HIV to infect cells.
* PrEP is most effective when taken correctly and consistently, ideally 21 days before exposure to HIV.

PrEP is available through a doctor's prescription and is usually covered by insurance. It's a safe and effective way to prevent HIV infection, with a 99% reduction in risk when taken daily.

**How is HIV Transmitted?**

HIV is usually spread through:

*   Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal) with an infected person
*   Sharing needles or injection equipment with an infected person
*   Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

**What are the Symptoms of HIV?**

Early symptoms of HIV can be similar to flu-like symptoms and may include:

*   Fever
*   Fatigue
*   Swollen lymph nodes
*   Skin rashes
*   Sore throat

**How is HIV Diagnosed?**

HIV is diagnosed through a blood test that detects the presence of the virus.",6.980275869369507

**What is HIV?**

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If left untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV is usually passed through:

* Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal)
* Sharing needles or injecting equipment with someone who has HIV
* From mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

**How can we prevent HIV?**

There are ways to prevent HIV, including:

* Getting tested regularly
* Using condoms or internal condoms correctly
* Taking PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) if you're at high risk
* Getting treatment if you have HIV

* Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal) with someone who has HIV
* Sharing needles or injection equipment with someone who has HIV
* Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding

Here's a simplified overview:

1. **Initial Infection**: HIV enters the body through mucosal tissues, such as those found in the vagina, anus, or rectum, or through needle sharing or other forms of blood exposure.
2. **Attachment and Penetration**: HIV binds to the CD4 receptors on the surface of immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages. The virus then penetrates the cell membrane and releases its genetic material.

PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) is a daily medication that helps prevent HIV infection in people who don't have the virus. It's like taking a daily pill to protect against HIV.

**How PrEP works:**

PrEP creates a barrier in your cells that prevents HIV from entering and infecting them. When taken correctly, PrEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex or injecting drugs by about 99%.

**Who can use PrEP:**

PrEP is recommended for people who are at high risk of getting HIV, such as:

*   Those who have multiple sex partners
*   Those who have a sex partner with HIV who is not taking treatment
*   Those who inject drugs and share needles
*   Those who have had a previous HIV exposure

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), a condition where the immune system is severely damaged, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases.

**How is HIV transmitted?**

HIV is primarily spread through:

* Sharing needles or syringes with an infected person
* Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding
* Blood transfusions from an infected person (rare in developed countries due to strict screening)
