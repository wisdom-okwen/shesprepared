WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT YEZTUGO?

BEFORE RECEIVING YEZTUGO:
• You must be HIV-1 negative to start YEZTUGO
• You must get tested to ensure you do not have HIV-1
• Do not receive YEZTUGO unless confirmed HIV-1 negative
• Some HIV-1 tests can miss recent infections

If you have flu-like symptoms, you could have recently acquired HIV-1. Symptoms include:
- Tiredness
- Fever
- Joint or muscle aches
- Headache
- Sore throat
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Rash
- Night sweats
- Enlarged lymph nodes in neck or groin

Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu-like illness within the last month before starting YEZTUGO or at any time while receiving it.

WHILE RECEIVING YEZTUGO:
• YEZTUGO does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
  - Practice safer sex using latex or polyurethane condoms
  - Get tested for STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea)

• Stay HIV-1 negative to keep receiving YEZTUGO
  - Know your HIV-1 status and your partners' status
  - Ask partners with HIV-1 if they are taking anti-HIV-1 medicine with undetectable viral load
  - Undetectable viral load = virus amount too low to measure in lab test
  - Your HIV-1 risk is lower if partners are on effective treatment

• Get tested for HIV-1 with each YEZTUGO injection or as healthcare provider directs
• Do not miss any HIV-1 tests
• If you get HIV-1 and continue YEZTUGO without knowing, HIV-1 may become harder to treat
• Tell your healthcare provider immediately if exposed to HIV-1
• Get information and support to reduce sexual behaviors associated with HIV-1 risk
• Follow YEZTUGO dosing schedule, returning every 6 months for injections
• Missing YEZTUGO injections or tablets increases HIV-1 risk

If you get HIV-1, you will need to immediately take other medicines to treat it. YEZTUGO is not approved for HIV-1 treatment. Taking only YEZTUGO if HIV-1 positive may make the virus harder to treat over time.
