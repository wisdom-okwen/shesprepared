CDC Clinical Recommendation: Injectable Lenacapavir for PrEP (MMWR Vol. 74, No. 35; September 18, 2025)
Authors: Patel RR et al. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public document.

Headline Guidance
- Strong recommendation (high-certainty GRADE evidence) to offer subcutaneous lenacapavir every 6 months for PrEP to people ≥35 kg who would benefit from HIV prevention.
- Efficacy: PURPOSE 1 (cisgender women, South Africa/Uganda) reported 0 infections over 52 weeks; PURPOSE 2 (men and gender-diverse participants across 8 countries) reported 2 infections with protective drug levels, indicating 96% relative risk reduction vs. no PrEP and 89% vs. daily TDF/FTC.
- Safety: Adverse events similar to oral TDF/FTC except for higher rates of injection-site nodules/pain, which were mostly grade 1–2; discontinuation due to injection reactions ≤1.2%.

Clinical Implementation Checklist
- Eligibility: assess HIV risk behaviors/contexts, confirm weight ≥35 kg, exclude acute HIV symptoms. Obtain laboratory antigen/antibody test within 7 days before first injection; add RNA test at baseline when available (do not delay dosing while awaiting result).
- Dosing: Day 1 two 1.5 mL injections (total 927 mg) plus two 300 mg tablets; Day 2 two 300 mg tablets; maintenance injection every 26 weeks ±2 weeks.
- Follow-Up: repeat blood-based antigen/antibody test before each injection; counsel on adherence, risk-reduction, condoms, STI screening, mental health and social support; monitor nodules (may persist months) and educate on proper injection technique (90° angle, abdomen or anterior thigh).
- Missed Dose Strategy: if >14 days late, start weekly 300 mg oral bridging up to 6 months or switch to alternative PrEP; if >28 weeks since last injection with no oral cover, restart full initiation. Transition to another PrEP option within 28 weeks of last injection when stopping LEN to cover the pharmacokinetic tail.

Special Populations & Considerations
- Pregnancy/Breastfeeding: limited data show no safety signal; shared decision-making encouraged with ongoing surveillance (report cases to Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry).
- Hepatitis B: screen before switching from tenofovir regimens; ensure vaccination or provide alternative HBV therapy if tenofovir discontinued.
- Drug Interactions: adjust for strong/moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, certain anticonvulsants); monitor for increased exposure of CYP3A/P-gp substrates up to 9 months post-injection.

Programmatic Takeaways for ShesPrEPared
- Align clinic workflows with CDC Box guidance (testing cadence, counseling scripts, missed-dose playbooks).
- Integrate LEN into comprehensive packages alongside oral PrEP, CAB-LA, condoms, STI management, reproductive health, and behavioral support.
- Establish reminder systems (texts/calls) and early follow-ups to reinforce adherence, especially after initiation.
- Document injections, adverse events, pregnancies, and resistance testing outcomes to feed into national surveillance.
- Leverage CDC PrEPLine (855-448-7737) and National HIV PrEP Curriculum for provider consultation and training.

Knowledge Gaps Highlighted by CDC
- Effectiveness in people who inject drugs, long-term persistence, management of resistance or delayed dosing, and real-world service models remain under study (PURPOSE 4–5, implementation science).
