• RNA confirmation may occur after YEZTUGO initiation
• RNA-specific testing required even if results available after initiation

For ongoing screening:
• Negative results from rapid point-of-care antigen/antibody test must be confirmed with more sensitive assay

2.2 ADHERENCE REQUIREMENTS:
Healthcare providers should select individuals who:
• Agree to required testing schedule
• Agree to every 6-month injection dosing
• Understand importance of adherence to scheduled visits
• Understand adherence reduces HIV-1 acquisition risk and resistance development

2.3 RECOMMENDED DOSAGE SCHEDULE:

INITIATION PHASE:
Day 1:
• 927 mg by subcutaneous injection (2 × 1.5 mL injections)
• 600 mg orally (2 × 300 mg tablets)

  - Clinically reassess individual
  - Ensure individual remains HIV-1 negative
  - Restart with complete initiation dosing from Day 1 (if appropriate)
  - Then resume continuation injection dosing

Important Note: Adherence to injection schedule strongly recommended to prevent resistance development

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE HIV-1 ACQUISITION RISK:

USE AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY:
• Adherence to administration schedule
• Safer sex practices including condoms
• Risk reduction for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Note: YEZTUGO is not always effective

TIMING OF PROTECTION:
• Time to maximal protection from initiation is unknown
• Full loading dose (injections + tablets) required for protection Day 3
• Without oral loading dose, protection may not begin for 1+ month

BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS:
• Condomless sex
• Past or current STIs
• Sexual partners with unknown HIV-1 viremic status
• Sexual activity in high-prevalence areas or networks
• Self-identified HIV risk

COUNSELING REQUIREMENTS:
• Use of other prevention measures (condoms, partner status knowledge)
• Regular STI testing
• Reducing sexual behaviors associated with HIV-1 risk
• Importance of adherence and appointment attendance

BASELINE REQUIREMENTS:
• Confirm HIV-1 negative status before initiation
• Confirm with each injection
• Confirm additionally as clinically appropriate
• Evaluate for acute HIV-1 infection signs/symptoms (fever, fatigue, myalgia, rash)

5.2 POTENTIAL RISK OF RESISTANCE:

RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT RISK:
• Can occur if HIV-1 acquired before YEZTUGO use
• Can occur if HIV-1 acquired while receiving YEZTUGO
• Can occur after YEZTUGO discontinuation

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
• Test before each injection
• Additional testing as clinically appropriate
• Confirm HIV-1 negative status
• Special consideration if STI diagnosed

HIV-1 ACQUISITION DURING TREATMENT:
• If HIV-1 acquired and continues YEZTUGO alone (unknowingly):
  - HIV-1 becomes harder to treat over time
  - Must transition to complete HIV treatment regimen

5.3 LONG-ACTING PROPERTIES AND ASSOCIATED RISKS:

RESIDUAL CONCENTRATIONS:
• Lenacapavir remains in systemic circulation after discontinuation
• May persist for up to 12 months or longer
• Important for counseling about future pregnancy planning

IMPLICATIONS:
• Extended coverage may continue after stopping
• Potential for resistance if HIV acquired during residual phase
• Consider implications before discontinuation

5.4 SERIOUS INJECTION SITE REACTIONS WITH IMPROPER ADMINISTRATION:

IMPROPER ADMINISTRATION RISK:
• Intradermal injection associated with serious reactions
• Must use subcutaneous technique only

SERIOUS REACTIONS INCLUDE:
• Severe skin damage (necrosis)
• Open sores (ulcers)
• These are RARE when proper administration technique used

PREVENTION:
• Healthcare provider training essential
