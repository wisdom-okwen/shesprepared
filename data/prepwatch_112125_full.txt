EFFECTIVENESS DATA

CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS:
• Highly effective at preventing HIV in two large Phase III clinical trials

PURPOSE 1 Trial (Cisgender Women):
- Approximately 5,000 participants in South Africa and Uganda
- Early results: ZERO HIV infections in LEN for PrEP arm
- Unblinded June 2024 after meeting primary endpoint
- Showed superiority to oral PrEP (TDF/FTC)
- Scheduled to run until July 2027
- First Phase III trial to include pregnant and lactating people from start

PURPOSE 2 Trial (MSM, Trans, Non-Binary):
- Approximately 3,000 participants in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, South Africa, Thailand, USA
- Early results: Only 2 HIV infections in LEN for PrEP arm
- Unblinded September 2024 after meeting primary endpoint
- Showed superiority to oral PrEP (TDF/FTC)
- Scheduled to run until April 2027

ADDITIONAL PHASE II/III TRIALS:

PURPOSE 3:
- 250 cisgender women in USA
- Scheduled to run until January 2028

PURPOSE 4:
- 250 people who inject drugs in USA
- Scheduled to run until July 2027

PURPOSE 5:
- 262 MSM, gay men, trans men, trans women, gender non-binary in France and UK
- Scheduled to run until July 2029

PURPOSE 365 (12-Month Formulation):
- 300 people with PrEP indication in USA
- Intramuscular administration
- Scheduled to run until September 2028

KEY EFFECTIVENESS POINTS:
• Protection depends on adherence to loading dose schedule
• Full protection timeline with complete loading dose: Day 3
• May improve adherence vs daily pills due to longer-acting profile
• May be more discreet than daily pill regimen
• LEN for PrEP is not always 100% effective

SAFETY PROFILE

POPULATIONS STUDIED:
• Safe and effective for cisgender and transgender men and women
• Safe and effective for adolescents (eligibility based on weight 35+ kg, not age)
• Can be safely used by pregnant people
• Can be safely used by lactating people

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
• Injection site reactions (most common):
  - Pain
  - Swelling
  - Redness
  - Small lumps or nodules under skin
  - Usually mild and temporary
• Headache
• Nausea

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (Rare):
• Improper injection administration can lead to:
  - Severe skin damage (necrosis)
  - Open sores (ulcers)

DRUG INTERACTIONS:
• No significant interactions with gender-affirming hormone therapy
• May interact with some common medications requiring dosage adjustments:
  - High cholesterol medications
  - Erectile dysfunction medications
  - Tuberculosis medications
• Healthcare provider should review all medications before starting

RESISTANCE:
• LEN is from new class of antiretrovirals (capsid inhibitors)
• No other capsid inhibitors routinely used for prevention/treatment
• Rarity of breakthrough infections means resistance unlikely to be significant concern

WHAT IT DOES NOT PREVENT:
• Does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
• Does not prevent pregnancy
