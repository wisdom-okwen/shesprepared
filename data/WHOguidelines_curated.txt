WHO 2025 Guidelines on Lenacapavir (LEN) for HIV Prevention — Essential Chatbot Summary

Source: WHO Guidelines on Lenacapavir for HIV Prevention and Testing Strategies for Long‑Acting Injectable PrEP (2025). fileciteturn1file0

1. Purpose of the Guidelines
- WHO now recommends **six‑monthly injectable Lenacapavir (LEN)** as an **additional PrEP option** for people at risk of HIV.
- Goal: expand PrEP choices, improve uptake, and support simplified HIV testing approaches.

2. Core Recommendations
- **Recommendation 1 (NEW):** Offer LEN as an additional HIV prevention choice for people at risk of HIV (strong recommendation; moderate–high certainty).  
- **Recommendation 2 (NEW):** Use **rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)** for HIV testing when initiating, continuing, or discontinuing long‑acting injectable PrEP (strong recommendation; very low certainty).

3. Key Evidence Supporting LEN
Effectiveness:
- PURPOSE 1 and 2 trials (8,660 participants across Africa, Latin America, North America, Asia).  
- **LEN reduced HIV acquisition by ~100% in PURPOSE 1 and ~96% in PURPOSE 2.**
- LEN significantly outperformed daily oral TDF/FTC in both studies.

Safety:
- Overall adverse events similar to oral PrEP.
- Injection‑site reactions common but mostly mild; decrease over time.
- Very low discontinuation due to injection reaction.

Resistance:
- Two LEN breakthrough infections in PURPOSE 2 showed **N74D capsid inhibitor mutation**; overall resistance risk considered low but requires monitoring.

Pregnancy:
- PURPOSE 1 reported **193 pregnancies** among LEN users.  
- No increase in adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes vs. oral PrEP.
- No LEN dose adjustment required during pregnancy.

4. Testing Strategies for Long‑Acting PrEP
- HIV RDTs:
  - Faster turnaround, fewer missed injections, lower cost.
  - Similar accuracy for identifying HIV-positive cases compared to NAT.
  - Enable **same‑day LEN initiation**.
- HIV self‑testing (HIVST):
  - Limited evidence for use with injectable PrEP.
  - Still recommended for oral PrEP, DVR, and PEP.

5. Values and Preferences
End‑Users:
- High acceptability of injectable PrEP (CAB-LA data + early LEN data).
- Drivers: convenience, discreet use, long duration.
- Concerns: injection pain, clinic scheduling, misconceptions about waning protection.

Providers:
- Overall supportive of injectable PrEP.
- Prefer simplified testing (RDTs) to reduce workflow burden.

6. Feasibility & Implementation
- LEN was delivered across >120 clinical trial sites globally → suggests operational feasibility.
- Real‑world data pending; indirect evidence from CAB-LA shows successful integration into PrEP programs.
- Implementation must prioritize differentiated service delivery, including:
  - community‑based options  
  - task‑sharing  
  - multi‑month dispensing  
  - convenient touchpoints (pharmacy PrEP, TelePrEP)

7. Cost‑Effectiveness Insights
- Modelling shows LEN can be cost‑effective **if annual per-person cost remains within thresholds**.
- More cost‑effective in high‑incidence settings and when prioritized for high‑risk populations.
- Real-world cost unknown; affordability is a future concern.

8. Equity & Human Rights Considerations
- LEN may improve equity:
  - useful for people who struggle with daily pill adherence
  - dosing every six months reduces time and logistical barriers.
- BUT centralized clinic-only administration may limit accessibility → decentralized & community-led delivery is critical.

9. Practical Takeaways for Chatbot Integration
Your chatbot should be able to say:
- “WHO now recommends injectable Lenacapavir every six months as a highly effective HIV prevention option.”  
- “RDTs are recommended for HIV testing before and during injectable PrEP.”  
- “LEN showed extremely high protection against HIV in large trials across multiple countries.”  
- “Most side effects are mild, mainly small injection-site reactions.”  
- “Pregnancy data so far show no additional safety concerns.”  
- “People should choose the PrEP option (oral, injectable, ring) that best fits their lifestyle and preferences.”  
- “LEN is especially useful for those who prefer long-acting, discreet HIV prevention.”
