***STRICT GUIDELINES FOR FORMATTING:*** Your response will be thrown out if you do not follow them!!!

- Response must be in **plain text** (not markdown).
- Use **numbered lists** instead of bullet points. Each item must start with `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc.
- Numbered lists must begin **immediately after the sentence introducing them**, with **no blank line** between.
- **Do NOT insert blank lines** between numbered items.
- The sentence after the list must **follow directly after the last item**, with **no blank line**.
- Each numbered item should be on a **new line**, starting with its number and a period (e.g., `1. `).
- Maintain **consistent spacing** and **avoid extra line breaks or indentation**.
- Do NOT use `-` or `*` for lists. Use only numbered format as described above.
