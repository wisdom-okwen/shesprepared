It is often a protein or carbohydrate found on the surface of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, or on the surface of infected or abnormal cells. When the immune system detects an antigen, it activates immune cells to produce antibodies, which specifically target and neutralize the antigen, helping to protect the body from infections and diseases. Antigens can also be used in laboratory tests to diagnose conditions, including HIV."

Here are more details about **PrEP**:\n\n- **Definition**: PrEP stands for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, a preventive strategy for those at high risk of HIV.\n\n- **Forms**:\n  - **Daily Pill (Truvada)**: Taken once daily, it is highly effective when adhered to consistently.\n  - **Injectable PrEP (CAB-LA)**: Administered every two months, providing an alternative for those who prefer not to take daily pills.\n\n- **Effectiveness**: Oral PrEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission from sexual activity by approximately 99% when taken as prescribed.\n\n- **Target Population**: \n  - Individuals with multiple sexual partners.\n  - Those in relationships with HIV-positive partners, especially if the partner is not virally suppressed.\n\n- **Consultation and Monitoring**: It is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice, including discussions about side effects, routine HIV testing every three months, and kidney function monitoring.\n\nIf you need further information or have specific questions about PrEP, feel free to ask!"

        "bot": "**HIV** (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial for immune function. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), the most severe phase of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely compromised.\n\n### Key Points About HIV:\n- **Transmission**: Primarily spread through unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, and from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding.\n  \n- **Symptoms**: Early symptoms may include flu-like signs, but many people may not experience symptoms for years.\n\n- **Diagnosis**: Confirmed through blood tests that detect either the virus itself or antibodies produced in response to it.\n\n- **Treatment**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively manage HIV, allowing individuals to live long, healthy lives and significantly reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nIf you have more questions about HIV or its prevention, feel free to ask!"

By diminishing these cells, HIV weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, this progression can lead to **AIDS** (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), the final stage of HIV infection, characterized by severe immune system damage.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Transmission**: \n  - Primarily occurs through unprotected anal or vaginal sex, where bodily fluids are exchanged.\n  - Sharing of needles or syringes with an infected person also poses significant risk.\n  - Vertical transmission can occur during childbirth or breastfeeding, where an HIV-positive mother can pass the virus to her child.\n\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - Initial symptoms may include fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and sore throat, resembling flu-like illness.\n  - Many may remain asymptomatic for years, during which the virus continues to replicate and damage the immune system.\n\n- **Diagnosis**: \n  - Blood tests can detect the presence of HIV or the antibodies produced in response. Common tests include ELISA and rapid tests, with confirmatory tests like Western blot used for definitive diagnosis.\n\n- **Treatment**: \n  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of a combination of HIV medicines that help control the virus, allowing individuals to maintain a healthy immune system and significantly reduce the risk of transmission to others.\n  - With consistent treatment, many achieve an undetectable viral load, meaning the virus is not transmissible through sex.\n\nIf you have further questions about HIV, its treatment options, or prevention methods, feel free to ask!"

        "bot": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a more detailed overview of HIV:\n\n### Understanding HIV:\n- **Mechanism**: HIV specifically infects CD4 T cells, which orchestrate the immune response. As HIV replicates, it kills these cells, leading to a gradual decline in immune function. This leaves the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis) and certain cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Transmission**: \n  - **Sexual Contact**: Unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse is the primary mode of transmission, as bodily fluids (semen, vaginal fluids) can carry the virus.\n  - **Needle Sharing**: Sharing needles or syringes with an infected individual can introduce HIV directly into the bloodstream.\n  - **Mother-to-Child Transmission**: An HIV-positive mother can transmit the virus during childbirth or breastfeeding, emphasizing the importance of testing and treatment during pregnancy.\n\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - **Acute HIV Infection**: Initial symptoms often mimic flu-like illness, including fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and sore throat, occurring within 2-4 weeks post-infection.\n  - **Chronic Phase**: Many individuals remain asymptomatic for years, during which the virus continues to replicate, often without noticeable symptoms.\n\n- **Diagnosis**: \n  - **Testing Methods**: Blood tests like ELISA can detect HIV antibodies or the virus itself; rapid tests provide quicker results. Confirmatory tests, such as Western blot, are used to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Treatment**: \n  - **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Involves a combination of HIV medications that suppress viral replication. This enables individuals to maintain immune function and significantly reduces the risk of transmitting HIV to sexual partners.\n  - **Undetectable Viral Load**: With consistent adherence to ART, many achieve an undetectable viral load, which means the virus is not transmissible through sex ( (Response truncated.
