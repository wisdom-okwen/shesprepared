1. What factors influence response time, and how does it vary across interactions?

2. Is there a trade-off between response time and quality in user satisfaction?

3. How coherent are multi-turn conversations? Do users frequently repeat or rephrase questions due to unclear responses?

4. How well do models handle shifts in topic or ambiguous questions? Are certain models better at maintaining conversational context?

5. Are users better informed about HIV prevention and PrEP after interacting with the chatbot? (Follow-up studies or surveys could be linked to timestamps.)

6. Do conversations lead to measurable outcomes, such as accessing PrEP services or adopting prevention measures?

7. How well do responses align with user values and goals? Is there evidence of personalized or value-sensitive counseling?

8. How accessible are the modelâ€™s explanations across different literacy levels?

9. Are there disparities in response clarity or usefulness based on linguistic complexity?

10. Do models appropriately address the needs of diverse user groups, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, injecting drug users, or different cultural backgrounds?

11. Are there recurring missed opportunities where the model could have provided actionable advice but did not?

12. What are the most common errors in responses (e.g., factual inaccuracies, ambiguous phrasing, incomplete answers), and how can they be mitigated?

13. How do user needs and behavior evolve over time, especially in response to changes in public health policy or events (e.g., new PrEP formulations)?

14. How do updates to model architectures or training data affect the quality and impact of interactions?

15. Could combining models (e.g., GPT + Llama) lead to improved accuracy or diversity in responses?

16. Do specialized models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (focused on a domain) outperform generalized models in user satisfaction and education?
