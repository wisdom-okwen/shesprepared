                Oral PrEP (Truvada/Descovy): May cause mild side effects like nausea, headaches, or upset stomach, usually resolving in a few weeks.
                Injectable PrEP (Apretude): May cause injection site reactions (e.g., pain, swelling), fever, or fatigue. These also tend to be mild and decrease over time.
